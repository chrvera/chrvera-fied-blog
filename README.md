# chrvera-fied-blog

## Description

-The chrvera-fied blog allows the users to submit their   username, title of their blog and a short synopsis of their blog. Once submitted, the user is redirected to the blog page where they can see their post.
-The blog helps users submit their blog ideas and have the information stored locally.
-The creation of the blog allowed me to apply Javascript API's to a project and see its application in the real world

##Usage

-The landing page has a form that allows the user to enter their username, title and content of their blog entry and submit it.
-The user is then taken to the posting page where their entry is input into the blog. The user is given the option to change the display to light or dark or click to go back to the landing page.
